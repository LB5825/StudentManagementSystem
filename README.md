# Student Management System API

## Overview

The **Student Management System API** is a RESTful API designed for managing various aspects of a student management system, including students, teachers, courses, and departments. The API supports CRUD operations and uses Dapper as an ORM to interact with a SQL database. It also includes authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.

## Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

.NET SDK 8.0
SQL Server (local or remote instance)
Visual Studio or another code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StudentManagementSystem.git
cd StudentManagementSystem

Restore the project dependencies:
dotnet restore

Update the database connection string in appsettings.json:

{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=StudentDB;User Id=your_user;Password=your_password;"
  }
}

Run database migrations and seed the database if needed:
dotnet ef database update

Run the application:
dotnet run

The API will be available at https://localhost:5001.

## Environment Configuration
This project supports environment-based configurations. The configuration files are:

appsettings.Development.json: For development environment settings.
appsettings.Production.json: For production settings.

Ensure the correct environment is set when running the application:
dotnet run --environment Development

API Documentation
Swagger is used for API documentation and is accessible at:

https://localhost:5001/swagger or whatever localhost it shows up when you dotnet run the project
Here, you can explore all the endpoints, view request and response formats, and test the API interactively.

Testing
Unit Tests

The project uses xUnit for unit testing services and repositories. Run tests using the following command:
dotnet test

Integration Tests
Integration tests are implemented using an in-memory database to simulate real-world scenarios. Ensure the environment is set to testing before running integration tests.

## Development Guidelines

Code Style
Follow .NET and C# coding conventions.
Ensure all new features have corresponding unit and integration tests.
Use dependency injection to manage services and repositories.

## Common Questions to Ask During Development
Controller Implementation:

Is the controller following RESTful conventions?
Are status codes correctly returned for each response?

Service Layer:
Is the service layer decoupled from the controller?
Are business rules and logic handled here instead of the controller?

Repository Layer:
Are queries optimized for performance?
Does the repository handle edge cases (e.g., null results)?

Security:
Are endpoints properly secured with JWT authorization?
Are sensitive data fields being logged or exposed?
